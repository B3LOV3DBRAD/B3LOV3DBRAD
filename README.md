### About Me

I‚Äôve always had a natural connection with numbers. When I was younger, I loved breaking problems down and finding patterns‚Äîit just clicked for me. That interest grew into a real love for statistics, and over time, that curiosity pushed me toward studying data science.

My academic and project work has focused on applying data science techniques to real problems, including:

- üìà **[Portfolio Optimization Tool](https://github.com/B3LOV3DBRAD/PortfolioOptimizationTool)** ‚Äì Used clustering algorithms to group 120+ stocks and design investment strategies that outperformed the S&P 500 during backtesting.  
- üß† **[Heart Attack Classifier](https://github.com/B3LOV3DBRAD/HeartAttackClassifier)** ‚Äì Built and evaluated multiple ML models on a medical dataset (Bernoulli Na√Øve Bayes reached 86.9% accuracy and 0.94 AUC).  
- üèÄ **[NBA Draft Analysis](https://github.com/B3LOV3DBRAD/NBADraftAnalysis)** ‚Äì Explored 30+ years of NBA data using regression and statistical testing to find trends and predictors of player success.

During my internships at State Street and Intact Insurance, I worked on fintech products, data reporting, and large-scale analytics to support strategic decision-making.
I also tutored students at Wentworth, which pushed me to slow down, find clearer ways to explain complex ideas, and connect with people who think differently than I do.

What motivates me most is **uncovering the story behind the data** and turning it into something that can actually change decisions. It‚Äôs like Moneyball‚Äîusing numbers to see things differently, challenge intuition, and move with strategy instead of guesswork.

** In a field as competitive as data science, many can handle the technical demands‚Äîbut not everyone can bring art to the science. I take pride in bridging that gap: combining analytical rigor with thoughtful interpretation to uncover the stories hidden in the data.**
